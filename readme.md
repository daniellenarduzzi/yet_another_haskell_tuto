# Yet Another Haskell Tutorial

_Hal DaumÃ© III_

> The goal of the Yet Another Haskell Tutorial is to provide a complete intoduction to
the Haskell programming language. It assumes no knowledge of the Haskell language
or familiarity with functional programming in general. However, general familiarity
with programming concepts (such as algorithms) will be helpful. This is not intended
to be an introduction to programming in general; rather, to programming in Haskell.
Sufficient familiarity with your operating system and a text editor is also necessary.
